#+description: README file for the 'relocation' commands.

This is a collection of shell functions that work with the built-in 'cd'
command to allow you to move around the filesystem more quickly and easily.

There is currently no formal documentation for these commands, but there's
a [[https://blog0.steelcandy.org/2022-02-10-relocation-basics.html][blog post]] explaining the basics of using them.
